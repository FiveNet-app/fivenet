Heavily customized version of https://github.com/lucasvallejo1992/vue-notifications with TailwindUI magic and more added and adjusted.

**Examples**:

```typescript
add({
    title: 'Success!',
    content: 'Your action was successfully submitted',
    type: 'success',
});
add({
    title: 'Info!',
    content: 'Your action was successfully submitted',
    type: 'info',
});
add({
    title: 'Warning!',
    content: 'Your action was successfully submitted',
    type: 'warning',
});
add({
    title: 'Error!',
    content: 'Your action was successfully submitted',
    type: 'error',
